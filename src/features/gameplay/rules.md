In the context of web architecture, for a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, we can break down the entities based on how the game is structured in terms of **front-end**, **back-end**, and **data** flow. Here are some common entities:

### 1. **Player**

- **Attributes**: `name`, `id`, `symbol (X or O)`, `score`, `isCurrentPlayer`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Track player information (name, score).
  - Identify which symbol the player uses (X or O).
  - Maintain whose turn it is (if multiplayer).

### 2. **Game Board**

- **Attributes**: `grid`, `size`, `cells[]`, `winningCombination`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Represent the 3x3 grid (or NxN if a variant is played).
  - Maintain the state of each cell (empty, X, or O).
  - Track the winning combinations.

### 3. **Cell**

- **Attributes**: `position (row, column)`, `value (X, O, or empty)`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Represent each individual cell on the game board.
  - Store the state of the cell (whether it's marked with X, O, or is empty).

### 4. **Game State**

- **Attributes**: `isGameOver`, `isDraw`, `winner`, `turnCount`, `activePlayer`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Track whether the game is ongoing, ended, or a draw.
  - Maintain the current turn number.
  - Record the winning player or state if the game is complete.

### 5. **Game Session**

- **Attributes**: `gameId`, `players[]`, `moves[]`, `startTime`, `endTime`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Represent an instance of a game.
  - Store game metadata like player details, moves history, and timestamps.

### 6. **Move**

- **Attributes**: `player`, `position`, `timestamp`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Track each player's move during the game.
  - Store the player and the cell (position) that was marked.

### 7. **Match or Round (Optional)**

- **Attributes**: `matchId`, `games[]`, `overallWinner`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - If multiple rounds are played (like best of 3 or 5), track rounds and overall match outcomes.

### 8. **Game Logic**

- **Attributes**: `validateMove`, `checkWin`, `checkDraw`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle the core game rules (validate moves, check for wins, handle draws).
  - Calculate whether a player has won or if the game ended in a draw.

### 9. **Scoreboard (Optional)**

- **Attributes**: `playerScores[]`, `highScores[]`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Track the players' overall scores across games or sessions.
  - Maintain a history of high scores, if necessary.

### 10. **User Interface (UI)**

- **Attributes**: `boardUI`, `cellUI`, `statusMessage`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Render the game board and each individual cell.
  - Display status messages like "Player X's Turn", "Game Over", etc.
  - Respond to user input (like clicking on cells to make a move).

### **Interactions between Entities:**

- **Player** interacts with **Cell** (marks a move).
- **Game State** updates based on **Move** made by a **Player**.
- **Game Logic** evaluates the **Game Board** after each move to check for a winner or draw.
- The **UI** updates based on the **Game State** and player actions.

Each of these entities encapsulates a part of the game that is important for tracking state, rendering the UI, and facilitating gameplay. This structure allows for clear separation of concerns in both the back-end and front-end.
